It had a touchscreen display, email, fax, and phone capabilities, as well as a calendar and address book. It even had games like tic-tac-toe and could send faxes - all for the hefty price of $1,000 (around $1,800 today). This 'brick' of a phone weighed in at 18 ounces and had a battery life of about 8 hours. Who knew the first smartphone was such a powerhouse (literally!)?

It had a touchscreen display, email, fax, and phone capabilities, as well as a calendar and address book. It even had a few games, including Tic-Tac-Toe and a crossword puzzle. The device weighed in at a hefty 18 ounces and had a price tag of around $1,000. Despite its bulky size and steep price, the IBM Simon paved the way for the modern smartphones we use today.
